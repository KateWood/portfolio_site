<h3>Project 4: Applied Meaning</h3>

<p>Applied Meaning is a self-help tool. Users add their meaning categories (what is important to them), sub categories (specific parts of the overall meaning category), and behaviors (small tasks that can be performed regularly). Each user's Meaning Profile on the Applied Meaning website is visible only to them, and can be used daily to help the user live a happy and meaningful life.</p>
